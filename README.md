## 👤 About Me

My name is **Kauã Diniz**, I’m a 17-year-old student, self-taught programmer, and aspiring Computer Scientist from Uberlândia, Brazil.  
I’m not just another student — I’m a builder of dreams, fueled by purpose and passion.

I dream big. My eyes are set on **Harvard University**, the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)**, or **Oxford**, not because I want prestige — but because I want **impact**. I believe technology can change lives. My greatest goal is to use it to change mine and then, help others do the same.

## 🌱 My Origin Story

My academic journey hasn’t been easy. I repeated the first year of high school, struggled with ADHD, and for a while, I felt like I was falling behind.  
But these challenges didn’t break me — they built me. I started waking up at 5 AM, balancing school, work, coding, English, and personal projects. Even when things were slow or lonely, I never let go of the fire inside me.

While most teenagers are still finding their passions, I already found mine: **creating things that matter**.
